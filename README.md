# Experiments in Diffusion

This repository contains various notebooks experimenting with using Stable Diffusion for image generation on Google Colab.

## Notebooks

1. **inference_steps_video.ipynb**: This notebook generates a video from a prompt using different numbers of inference steps, demonstrating the effect of varying the number of steps on the output.

    - An example generated video can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/914370372?share=copy).

## Running Notebooks

Make sure to use a GPU-enabled runtime. You can allocate a GPU on Colab by selecting "Change runtime type" under the "Runtime" menu.
